# Next-word-prediction-project
The Next Word Prediction project leverages deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) to predict the most probable next word based on a given text input. Using Python, I processed a large text dataset by cleaning, tokenizing, and converting words into numerical sequences with NLTK and Keras' Tokenizer. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to learn contextual word relationships. The model was trained on padded sequences, optimized using RMSprop, and evaluated with categorical cross-entropy loss. Once trained, the model could generate meaningful word predictions based on user input. For deployment, I used Flask to create a web-based API, enabling real-time next-word suggestions. This project highlights Pythonâ€™s capability in deep learning and NLP, making it useful for applications like chatbots, text autocompletion, and AI-assisted writing tools.
